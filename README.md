Graph Coarsening

- Serial version of Graph Coarsening Algorithm proposed by: "Parallel, Portable Algorithms for Distance-2
Maximal Independent Set and Graph Coarsening" -- Brian Kelleyand Sivasankaran Rajamanickam -- Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico, U.S.A

- csv = csv files of graphs
- suitesparse = suitesparse graphs downloaded
- coarse_serial.py = serial version of coarsening algorithm proposed in paper
    - given an input graph and a "goal graph size", it will output a coarsened graph that is of size <= to the given goal size
